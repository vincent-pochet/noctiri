# build/validate-brewfiles.sh is the single implementation of Brewfile
# validation. It exists because Brewfiles are a Ruby DSL: handing a
# PR-controlled Brewfile to `brew bundle` / `brew bundle check` executes it.
# `pre-commit run --all-files` runs in CI (pr-validation.yml ->
# projectbluefin/actions/bootc-build/validate-pr), so a local hook that
# re-implements Brewfile handling re-opens that path by a second route.
#
# These tests fail if the hook stops being a caller of the single
# implementation, or starts evaluating repository Brewfiles again.
#
# Run with: bats tests/template/precommit-brewfile-hook_test.bats
